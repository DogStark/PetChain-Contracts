### 🔨 Build and Test Smart Contracts

Before contributing to PetChain's smart contracts, make sure you have [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) installed — it's the Rust package manager and build tool.

Once you’ve cloned the repo and installed the dependencies, here are the most important commands to get started:

```bash
# Build the contracts
scarb build
```
 This compiles all the smart contracts in the project. Run this after making changes to confirm everything still compiles correctly.

```bash
# Run the tests
scarb test
```
This runs the test suite for the contracts. Use it to make sure your changes don’t break existing functionality.
